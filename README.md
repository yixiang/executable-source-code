# executable-source-code

This respository contains some source files that are executable, in languages that would normally require compilation as a prior step.

## How to use?

E.g. To run the C source file, you can type the following commands into Mac/Linux terminal.
```
$ chmod +x executable.c
$ ./executable.c hello
```

## Why do I need this?

 * You can write simple single source-file command-line tools in C/C++/Java etc. and deploy them as-is. You favorite language suddenly becomes a scripting language as well.
 * Or think of other innovative use of this.

## How does it work?

The first line of the source files is a comment in the target language, but it is at the same time a bash command that compiles the file itself and runs the compilation result.

## How make create my own executable files?

To make your own executable source files:
 1. Open the file in the language of choice
 2. Copy the first 3 lines of code to your own source file.
 3. `$ chmod +x path/to/your_file`
 4. `$ path/to/your_file`
