# executable-source-code

This respository contains some source files that are executable, in languages that would normally require compilation as a prior step.

E.g. you can do the following to run a C file.
```
$ chmod +x executable.c
$ ./executable.c hello
```

To make your own executable source files, open the file in the language of choice and copy the first few lines of code to your own source file.
